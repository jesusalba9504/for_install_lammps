the explanation is obvious from reading the fix efield documentation.
it very clearly states that what fix efield does is adding a charge
dependent force to atoms. that is a crude empirical approximation to
how charged particles react to an external field. it does *not* in any
form model how an electric field would influence the charge
distribution. the charge equilibration process in reax has no
knowledge of it. technically, there is no electrical field, but just
an added force. if you want to model the reaction of a system modeled
with reaxff under an external electrical field, you have to modify the
reaxff code accordingly in a rather non-trivial manner.
